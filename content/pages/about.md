I work on programmability and debugging of deep neural networks.

My work investigates three questions.

* Can knowledge from several neural networks be tranplanted together
  economically?
* Can latent knowledge be cleanly encapsulated within deep networks?
* Can tools be created to allow programmers to effectively debug and design
  deep neural networks?

I am also interested in programming tools that make computer science
more accessible to beginners and non-expert programmers. I believe
passionately that the technologies created by humanity should be
programmable by all.

Prior to starting at MIT, I worked in the software industry for 18 years,
where I contributed to several widely used projects.  At Google I was
a staff software engineer on
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=bieber+haircut">Google Image Search</a>
and <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Google Talk</a>.
At Microsoft I helped create
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_4">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a>.
At the startup
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossgain">Crossgain</a>
I helped create the
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13214_01/wli/docs81/overview/1intro.html">Weblogic Workshop IDE</a>.
I have created several open-source projects including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLBeans">XMLBeans</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom">seedrandom.js</a>,
and a <a href="http://davidbau.com/about/hacks.html">and a variety of other hacks</a>.

I created <a href="http://pencilcode.net/">Pencil Code</a>, a programming tool
for beginners that introduces several innovations that
bridge the gap between beginner coding and mainstream programming.
It has a block code editor that smoothly bridges to text, and it
includes a turtle graphics environment that smoothly bridges to
mainstream web programming. The system helps students transition
to text-based programming remarkably quickly; I have published
several papers about the system, its components, and its efficacy.

I am coauthor of the textbook
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Linear-Algebra-Lloyd-Trefethen/dp/0898713617"><em>Numerical Linear Algebra</em></a>,
with Nick Trefethen, which I wrote while I was at Cornell.
It provides a conceptual, mathematical introduction to
the field. If you would like a principled overview of the
fundamental algorithms behind matlab, or if you are worried about
things like the stability, conditioning, or the imprecision of
floating-point arithmetic in your large matrix algorithms,
the book is worth a read.
