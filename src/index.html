<p>In our quest to invent and improve automation,
computer scientists must not relinquish humanity's ability to
program computers. Our reaction to a complex world
should be to create transparency.</p>
<p>As a PhD student in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/"
>Antonio Torralba's lab</a>, I develop techniques that increase
interpretability
of deep neural networks. I have found evidence that the
representations learned by deep networks can have a
simple underlying structure.
The focus of my research at MIT is therefore to
find ways to enhance and exploit this structure
to make deep networks more transparent.</p>
<p>I also work on programmability as seen as a
broader human-computer interaction problem. I develop
novice programming interfaces, introductory lessons, open standards,
and libraries that make computer systems more broadly programmable.

Network Dissection</a>
is a technique for quantifying and automatically
estimating the human interpretability (and interpretation) of units
within any deep neural network for vision.
<span class="more"></span>
<span class="extra">
Building upon a surprising
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6856">2014 finding by Bolei Zhou</a>,
network dissection defines a dictionary of 1197 human-labeled
visual concepts, each represented as a segmentation problem, then
it estimates interpretability by evaluating each hidden convolutional
unit as a solution to those problems.
I have used network dissection to reveal that representation space is
not isotropic: learned representations have an unusually high agreement
with human-labeled concepts that vanishes under a change in basis.
We will be giving an oral presentation about
the technique and the insights it provides at the July 2017 CVPR conference.

Blocks and Beyond</a>
is a workshop I helped organize to bring together researchers who are
investigating blocked-based interfaces to simplify programming for
novices and casual programmers.
<span class="more"></span>
<span class="extra"> The workshop was oversubscribed, and the presented
work was interesting both for its breadth and depth.  Afterwards, we
wrote a review paper to survey the history, foundations, and
state-of-the-art in the field.
The review appears in the June 2017 Communications of the ACM.</span>

<span class="extra">Developed together with my son and with the generous
support of Google, this system provides a blocks-based editing environment
with turtle graphics on a canvas that smoothly transitions to text-based
editing of web applications using jQuery. Two thousand students use the
system each day. A study of middle-school
students using the environment suggests suggests the block-and-text
transitions are an aid to learning.</span>

<span class="extra">I led the team to create Google Talk in an (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to establish a universal federated open realtime communication ecosystem for the internet.  Our messaging platform provided full-scale support for XMPP and Jingle, which are open standards for federating real-time chat and voice that are analogous to the open-for-all SMTP system for email. To this day, open realtime communications remains an unfulfilled dream for the internet.</span>
